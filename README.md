# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## my Task

This week’s homework is to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

GIVEN you need a new, secure password
WHEN you click the button to generate a password
THEN you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN you select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN you choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN you confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN you answer each prompt
THEN you input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
